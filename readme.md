Bash utilities to work with github, matching my setup / workflow

## Description

Yet another uselessware.

I â™¥ bash scripting, and I want to learn more.

I needed some kind of my very-own
mini[hub](https://github.com/defunkt/hub), eventually with git / bash as
the only required dependencies. That's it.


## Usage

    $ minihub
    Usage: minihub [command]

    Commands:

      browse              open the GitHub repository page
      clone               clone the git repo in $MINIHUB_PREFIX/<user>/<repo> location
      issue               open the given issue in default browser
      edit                Opens the project folder in the default editor
      help                print this msg

    Env:

      $MINIHUB_PREFIX    clone install location, defaults to ~/src.
      $MINIHUB_BROWSER   the browser that is called by minihub to open websites.
      $MINIHUB_EDITOR    the editor that is called by minihub with the edit
                         command, defaults to mvim.
